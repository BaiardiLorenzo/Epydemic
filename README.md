# EPYDEMIC

The project aims to simulate the spread of an epidemic and analyze how both viral transmission and the dissemination of information influence the dynamics of contagion within a population.  

In particular, the study models epidemic propagation on multiplex networks, where each layer represents a distinct form of interaction (e.g., physical contact and information exchange). This framework enables the exploration of how the diffusion of information about the epidemic affects individual behavior and, consequently, how these behavioral changes influence the overall progression of the epidemic.
## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`main.py`**: The main script to run the epidemic simulations.
- **`src/`**: Contains the core implementation of the simulation model and related functions.
- **`report/`**: Includes the final report documenting the methodology, analysis, and conclusions.
- **`results/`**: Stores the output data and visualizations generated from the simulations.
- **`paper/`**: Provides reference papers and literature that informed the development of the project.

## Key Features

- **Multiplex Network Modeling**: Simulates the spread of the epidemic across interconnected layers representing physical and informational interactions.
- **Behavioral Feedback Loop**: Analyzes how information dissemination influences individual risk perception and modifies epidemic dynamics.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows the configuration of infection rates, recovery rates, and information diffusion speed.
- **Data Output**: Generates detailed results, including time-series data and network visualizations for further analysis.
